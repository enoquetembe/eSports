This project was developed during the rockseat NLW event, and it's focused on the eSports area. This project is to provide a bridge for people who play the same games to connect. <br>
It's like a Tinder Gamer, where people can connect each other to play together.


## How can you find your Duo?

You can find your duo by posting an ad identifying the game you like to play, people will see your ad and if they want to play
with you they will connect with you. Or you can see the ads already published and choose your duo to connect with them and play 
the game you like to play together.
